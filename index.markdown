I am a software engineer at LINE Corporation who is working for developing
[load balancer service](https://speakerdeck.com/line_devday2019/software-engineering-that-supports-line-original-lbaas)
of in-house cloud infrastracture. Before join to the LINE, I was a master student of Keio University.
My primary research topic was acceleration of [L7 proxies with emerging programmable dataplane technology](https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi21/presentation/hayakawa).
